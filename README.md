KODInfo is a plugin that generates .nfo files that KODI, Plex and other platforms can read in order to tag music for different purposes like searching and organizing.

The documentation on KODI's music tagging can be found [here](http://kodi.wiki/view/Music_tagging)

This plugin generates the .nfo file containing a URL that points to the corresponding album page on a MusicBrainz scraper site.

This is just an initial version in early development that tags albums (no artists yet!)
